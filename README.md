```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

The demo app of the Micro news app has been hosted on Heroku and can be found at https://micro-news-app.herokuapp.com/.
